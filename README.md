Predict the temperature using past years tempearture data
Summary
In descriptive statistics, a time series is defined as a set of random variables ordered with respect to time. Time series are studied both to interpret a phenomenon, identifying the components of a trend, cyclicity, seasonality and to predict its future values.
In particular, we will go through:
trend analysis to determine whether it is linear or not as most models require this information as input
outliers detection to understand how to spot and handle them
stationarity test to understand if we can assume that the time series is stationary or not
seasonality analysis to determine what is the best seasonal parameter to use when modeling.
